# Using ACE2 to run a "game" simulation using Reinforcement Learning
***

## Pytorch Code
***
This code was written in python 3.8.17 with PyTorch 2.0.0 and numpy 1.24.4. 

Within the RL code:
* ```climate_control_env.py``` Custom Gymnasium environment used to run RL model
* ```ace_data_funcs.py``` Contains data processing code
* ```initial_ace_test.py``` Runs ACE2 and feeds it into the custom Gym env
